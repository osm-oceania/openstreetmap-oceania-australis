# OpenStreetMap Oceania Australis Style

*A uniquely Australian map style*

The purpose of the Australis style is to:

* Promote collaboration and common purpose in OpenStreetMap’s Oceania mapping community
* Express the cultures of Oceania through cartography
* Showcase the richness of OpenStreetMap data
* Provide a more useful map for an Australian audience

The goal is to support all the cultures of Oceania, though to achive this we need diversity in our contributors. We're starting with the Australis variant but welcome other style variants for other cultures.

We are inspired by [OpenStreetMap Americana](https://github.com/osm-americana/openstreetmap-americana/) and take much inspiration from the project.

Scope to support a range of themes such as topographic. roads, public transport, emergency, infrastructure, POIs and accessibility.

## Features

Some of the things we aim to do differently to other OpenStreetMap styles may include:

* Indigenous name labels including `name:aus` and all other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages.
* Localised public transport iconography
* Localised address unit formatting
* Support for the AWTGS bushwalking scale `hiking_scale:awtgs=*`
